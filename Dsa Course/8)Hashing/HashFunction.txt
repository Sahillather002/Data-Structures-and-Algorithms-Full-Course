Introducing Hash Function
- it should generate same output for 
a particular input
- i.e. it should always map a large key to 
same small key
- it should generate value from 0 to m-1
- it should be fast , 
O(1) for integers 
and O(len) for string 
- it should unifromly distribute large
keys into hash table slots

Example of hash function --
- for integers
h(large_key) = large_key % m
m = any integer
m = is chosen as prime no close to no of data
m = is bad which is close to powers of 2 or 10
or we avoid having powers 

- for strings , weighted sum
str[] = "abcd"

(str[0] * x^0 + str[1]*x^1 + str[2]*x^2 + str[3]*x^4)%m

- Universal Hashing
we randomly select hash function
to get O(1)
