Introducing Hash Function
- it should generate same output for 
a particular input
- i.e. it should always map a large key to 
same small key
- it should generate value from 0 to m-1
- it should be fast , 
O(1) for integers 
and O(len) for string 
- it should unifromly distribute large
keys into hash table slots
