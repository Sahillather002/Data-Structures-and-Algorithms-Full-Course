// Collision Handling
- if we know keys in advance , then
we can have perfect Hashing

- if we do not know keys , then we 
use one of the following
 --- chaining
 --- open addressing
     --- linear probling
     --- qudaratic probling
     --- double Hashing

- Concept of BIRTHDAY PARADOX

-- if there are 23 people in a room then
there is 50% probability that they have
birthday on same date 

-- if there are 70 people in a room then 
there is 99.9% probability that they have
birthday on same date

-- so collision is serious if we don't 
know our keys in before
