// Cycle sort
/* 
-- worst case O(n^2) sorting algo
-- it does minimum memory writes and can 
be useful for cases where memory write
is costly
-- it is in-place - means it does not 
requires extra space
and not stable - if there are two equal
elements then there positions may change
-- useful to solve questions like find
minimum swaps required to sort and array
